#TesinaMaturita


This repository contains the work that I made few years ago (june 2014) when I finished high school.

I have not touched it since so it's exactly how it was.

In Italy when we finish high school we usually choose a topic and talk few minutes about that, and this was the topic I choosed: cryptography (and few details about RSA).

The presentation is build using html and css, with some images (exported from some MS PowerPoint slides I realized).

The "nice thing" about this was that I built a solution to remotely control slides navigation and I did that using websockets, which were a really new technology when I realized it.

I used an iPhone (if i remember correctly, it was an iPhone 3GS) to control it, using an ad-hoc (horrible!) web interface, which you can find in the controller/ directory.

Please note that this code was written in 2014, few years ago, when things and technology were different than now, and I did not have much experience. I decided to make this repository public just to share it.
